My first seminary goal is passing the Advanced Standing Exam[^1] for Bible Survey.
In future posts, I'll break down how I'm studying for each section of the exam:

- Biblical figures and the books in which they appear
- Places of significance in biblical history
- Dates of significance in biblical history
- Themes of the biblical books
- Biblical verses from memory
- [Canonical order of the biblical books](/seminary/bible-books-quiz)

[^1]: If you pass an exam, you can earn credit for a course without having to take it.
