If you pass an Advanced Standing Exam, you can earn credit for a course without having to take it.
My first seminary goal is passing the exam for Bible Survey.

The study guide[^1] for the exam states that you need to know the following:

> Biblical figures and the books in which they appear<br>
> Places of significance in biblical history<br>
> Dates of significance in biblical history<br>
> Themes of the biblical books<br>
> Biblical verses from memory<br>
> Canonical order of the biblical books

In future posts, I'll break down each of the sections above and how I'm studying for them.

[^1]: The study guide is only available to Calvin Seminary students. To avoid plagiarism, I won't copy and paste anything beyond what the exam is testing you on.
