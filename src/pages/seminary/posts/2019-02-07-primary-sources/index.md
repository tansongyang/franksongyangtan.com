For any historical topic, it's valuable to distinguish between primary and secondary sources of information.
A primary source is a firsthand account of what happened, while a secondary source is an indirect account.

Let's say that you become famous and people want to study your life.
Primary sources would include your personal journal entries and interviews with people who knew you.
Secondary sources would include other books that have been written about you.

Both kinds of sources have their strengths.
Secondary sources, for example, are useful for giving you the big picture.
They allow you to benefit from someone else's research and interpretation.

Still, I find primary sources to be more rewarding.
They give you more direct access to the thoughts and feelings of historical figures.
Indeed, all secondary sources ultimately rely on primary sources.
I'm not saying primary sources are betterâ€”but I do like them more.
