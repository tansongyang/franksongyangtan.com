I wrote that <x-link to='/seminary/why-i-love-history'>the goal of studying history</x-link> is to help us understand the present.
And when we understand the present, we can better engage with the world.
For Christians, that means loving others in a more informed and responsible way.

I also wrote about <x-link to='/seminary/be-careful-with-history'>things to watch out for</x-link> when we read history.
That post mostly focused on remembering that history is written by historians and that historians have goals that may affect their writing.

But we as readers also have goals, and that can affect our reading!

## (Temporarily) Forgetting Our Goals

I lean towards a Reformed Christian theology (which is one of the reasons I chose Calvin Theological Seminary).
This tempts me to see the Reformation as the movement that brought grace back to a graceless Christianity.
This also tempts me to downplay anything that goes against that idea.

But I really think that, while we're reading history, we need to forget our goals.
In order to get an accurate understanding, we need to read neutrally.
We can neither overemphasize things we agree with nor underemphasize things we don't.

After we've read neutrally, we can reflect.
We might have been correct.
But we might also need to change our minds.

## An Example

> How extremely necessary to me, O Lord, Your grace is to begin any good deed, to carry it on and bring it to completion!
> For without grace I can do nothing, but with its strength I can do all things in You.

If you're a Protestant like me, you might be surprised to learn that this quote is by Thomas à Kempis, a fifteenth-century Catholic monk.
It comes from <cite>The Imitation of Christ</cite> (chapter 55), a book that has been popular for centuries with all kinds of Christians.

I call it out specifically because it refutes my old ideas.
I can no longer believe that the medieval Roman Catholic Church had no notion of grace.
We have clear evidence that there were people who trusted in the grace of God.

## Conclusion

Since <x-link to='/seminary/be-careful-with-history#history-is-simplified'>history is simplified</x-link>,
we should expect to be surprised when we study it.
We won't always change our minds—for example, I still think the Reformation was a good thing overall—but we can at least not live with oversimplified and inaccurate ideas.
