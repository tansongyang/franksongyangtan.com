Last time, I wrote about <x-link to='/seminary/why-i-love-history'>why I love history</x-link>.
But there are also things to be careful about when we read history.

## History Is Simplified

For history to be practical and useful, it must be condensed.
All history is summary, and every historical topic has been simplified so that we can make sense of it.
We need to remember that the reality was probably more complicated.

## Historians Have Goals

Everyone has a goal.
Or, if you feel cynical, you can say that everyone has an agenda.

Not all "agendas" are bad.
For example, when we spend time with our loved ones, our "agendas" are to enjoy each other and have fun.
But the fact remains: humans do everything with a goal in mind.

So whenever we read history, we have to think about the historian and how their goals might have affected their writing.

## Conclusion

History is never "just the facts."
There are just too many facts!
All history comes through a historian's interpretation.

This doesn't mean that we can never trust a history book again.
It just means that we need to read history thoughtfully.
