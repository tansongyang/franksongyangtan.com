The <dfn>Hellenistic period</dfn> (323-31 BCE) was a time when Greek culture dominated the Mediterranean.

## Babylonians, Persians, Then Greeks

For most of the <x-link to="/seminary/judaism-time-jesus#the-second-temple-period">second temple period</x-link>, Jews in Jerusalem lived under foreign rule.

<x-link to="/seminary/judaism-time-jesus#the-second-temple-period">Recall</x-link> that Babylon conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the first temple.
Then the Persians defeated the Babylonians and allowed the Jews to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple.

In 336 BCE, Alexander the Great became king of the Greeks.
By 330 BCE, he had conquered Persia.
When he died in 323 BCE, his empire stretched from Egypt to parts of India.

## Two Greek Kingdoms

After Alexander the Great died, his generals fought over his empire.
The Ptolemaic Kingdom ruled the Jews for about a hundred years.
Then the Seleucid Empire gained control.

Generally, the Greeks allowed the Jews to worship according to Jewish law.
But Antiochus IV, a Seleucid king, wanted everyone in his kingdom to be Greek.
In 167 BCE, he banned Judaism.
He forced worship of Greek gods, burned Jewish scriptures, and vandalized the temple.

One Jewish family rose up and started a rebellion.
We will talk about them in a future post.
