My first class is Judaism in the Time of Jesus.
In this class, we study a time in history called the second temple period.

## The Second Temple Period

The <dfn>second temple period</dfn> begins in 538 BCE and ends in 70 CE.

Solomon built the first temple in Jerusalem in the 900s BCE.
The Babylonians destroyed it in 586 BCE when they conquered Jerusalem.
They then exiled many Jews to Babylon.

In 538 BCE, the Persians defeated the Babylonians.
That same year, the Persian king Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple.
They completed the second temple in 515 BCE, and it stood until the Romans destroyed it in 70 CE.

## Why Study the Second Temple Period?

Understanding the second temple period helps us understand Jesus' world.

The Bible is mostly silent about this period.
Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther all take place in the 400s BCE.
After that, the Bible records nothing until the birth of Jesus.

About four centuries passed before Jesus entered the story.
What happened?
I plan to cover the highlights in future posts.
