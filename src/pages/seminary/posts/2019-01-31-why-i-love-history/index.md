Over the past year, I've come to love history more and more.
I've realized that, instead of being dry and boring, history actually has the power to change how we think.
And how we think determines how we live.

## The Role of History: Understanding

In my view, the primary role of history is to tell us why things are the way they are today.
Studying the past helps us understand the present.

We've all experienced this at an individual level.
When we first meet a person, we ask about their current life.
As we get to know them more, we start asking about their past life—their personal history.
To really get to know someone, you have to understand how their past shaped them.

This is true not only of individuals but also of groups—families, nations, cultures.
In fact, learning someone's personal history can only get you so far.
Every individual exists as a member of various communities.
To really understand them, you have to learn about the communities they grew up in.

## Beyond Understanding

Understanding a person helps us interact with them in a constructive way.
If we know someone's past trauma, it helps us be patient with them in their present misbehavior.
If we want to persuade someone, we have to understand their values and where those values came from.

For Christians, the greatest commandments are to love God and love people.[^1]
And whether it is God or another person, I think the process is the same:
understanding the past helps us love in the present.
