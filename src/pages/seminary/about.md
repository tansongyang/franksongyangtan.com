# About my seminary series

Love, joy, and learning go together for me. I have always tried to learn more about
the things I love. The more I learn about something, the more I enjoy and appreciate it, which makes
me want to learn even more. And so the cycle continues.

I love God, and the next leg of my learning journey is with
<a href="https://www.calvinseminary.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calvin Seminary</a>.
I'm taking classes online and part-time and writing about them here.

You can think of this series as **SparkNotes for seminary**. I take class content and try to present
it in concise summaries. If you want an idea of what a seminary education is like, I hope this will
be informative and useful to you.
